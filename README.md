This project is a **Music Recommendation System** built using the *Spotify Music Dataset*. The system leverages audio features and K-means clustering to recommend songs similar to the ones provided by the user.

## Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key attributes like popularity, acousticness, energy, etc.,
- Visualization of trends in music features over time and across genres.
- Clustering of songs and genres using **K-means**, with visualization through **t-SNE** and **PCA**.
- Using Spotify Web API for fetching song data.
- Cosine similarity-based recommendation system for music suggestions.

## Technologies Used  

- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Spotipy, Yellowbrick, Streamlit
- **ML Techniques**: Clustering (K-means), Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE), Cosine Similarity
